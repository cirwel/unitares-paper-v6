**In one line:** UNITARES tracks each AI agent's behavioral state continuously, intervenes when an agent starts drifting, and produces an audit trail of the interventions.

## What the paper argues

Governance of autonomous AI agents is usually assembled from output filters, dashboards, and post-hoc evaluators — each operating on a population the designer imagined as roughly homogeneous. UNITARES argues that this assumption fails once a real fleet is heterogeneous: embodied agents with sensor-driven state, persistent autonomous services, session-bounded coding assistants, and ephemeral parser agents do not share an output modality, a tempo, or a healthy operating point. Fleet-wide normalization is then the wrong target, and a governance framework that collapses the population to a single distribution — what we call *cosmological soup* — loses signal exactly where signal matters.

The paper makes two structural moves:

1. **Information-theoretic target semantics for the EISV state vector** (the deployed system computes all four coordinates with tier-3 heuristic estimators; the higher tiers are specified, not implemented) — `S` as Shannon entropy of the response distribution, `I` as mutual information between context and response, `E` as negative variational free energy, `V` as accumulated free-energy residual. Each coordinate ships with a tiered computation recipe (logprob, multi-sample, heuristic) and a provenance-tagged scale constant.

2. **Class-conditional calibration** — scale constants and healthy operating points are functions of an agent class, keyed on existing identity tags, with fleet-wide defaults retained only as fallback. Phase 2 measurement on five production classes (Lumen, Sentinel, Vigil, Watcher, default) over a 30-day window is reported in §11.5; per-class manifold radii span a 3.3× range, directly contradicting the fleet-wide assumption.

## The headline finding

A verdict counterfactual on a 13,310-row production slice (§11.6) shows that **28.9% of governance basin assignments flip** when the grounded class-conditional coherence replaces the legacy fleet-wide `tanh` form on the same state vectors. Flip rates range 15–33% per class, with a dominant directional bias into the `low` basin — the fleet-wide form was systematically permissive relative to tighter class envelopes. The homogenization-failure-mode argument has first-order consequences at the gating layer, not only at the reported-value layer.

Much of the flip rate is mechanical: the legacy coherence is nearly constant (about 0.49 for every agent), so substituting any varying score moves basins. The counterfactual shows that the formula choice changes gating labels, not that the new labels are correct.

This is a *static* reclassification measurement: the same state vectors, two coherence formulas, count the disagreements. It does not depend on the multi-agent coupling machinery of §sec:network (which v6.7 reframed as a theoretical extension rather than a deployed mechanism — see *Version history* below), and its conclusion survives that correction intact.

## The methodological contribution

Re-grounding a deployed framework while service continues is a live-systems problem distinct from the mathematical one. §12 documents a **pipeline-ordering migration mechanism** that separates decision-producing from presentation-producing pipeline stages: governance verdicts fire on legacy values while the grounding computation runs as a post-verdict enrichment, so grounded values populate canonical response fields without changing live governance behavior. The mechanism generalizes beyond UNITARES — any deployed agent framework facing a semantic-coordinate change can apply it, given a request pipeline with explicit ordering between decision and presentation stages.

## Scope

The contraction analysis (Appendix B), the grounded coordinate definitions (§4), and the class-conditional calibration protocol (§8) are fully specified. The manifold-coherence path is measured per-class on production data. The `S_scale`, `I_scale`, `E_scale` constants — used only by the higher-fidelity tier-1 (logprob) and tier-2 (multi-sample) estimators — remain provenance-tagged placeholders awaiting inference-layer instrumentation. Per-class results in §11.5 are a descriptive measurement on the deployed system rather than a controlled validation study across stable parameter regimes; the paper flags this explicitly (§11.7).

The §Multi-Agent Network section (§sec:network, eq:network, thm:network) presents a theoretical coupled-dynamics extension — not the deployed mechanism. The within-class synchronization theorem is used only as a qualification on homogenization claims elsewhere in the paper.

## Reading aids

- **Variational free energy** (`−F`, the target semantics of the `E` coordinate) — the Free-Energy-Principle quantity measuring how well an agent's predictions match outcomes; high `E` = low surprise.
- **Cosmological soup** — the failure mode of averaging a heterogeneous agent fleet into a single state distribution, in which no population structure survives normalization.
- **Manifold coherence** (`C = 1 − ‖Δ‖₂ / ‖Δ‖_max`) — distance from the agent class's healthy operating point, used as a class-conditional replacement for the legacy `tanh`-of-`V` coherence.
- **Basin flip** — a change in governance-basin assignment (`high` / `boundary` / `low`) when the same state vector is classified under different coherence formulas.

## Building the PDF

Either toolchain works; [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) is preferred for reproducibility since it downloads its own font and package snapshots:

```bash
# Tectonic (self-contained, single pass)
tectonic unitares-v6.tex

# Classic TeX Live (two passes for cleveref + bibliography)
pdflatex unitares-v6.tex
pdflatex unitares-v6.tex
```

Required packages: `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `mathtools`, `bm`, `graphicx`, `booktabs`, `hyperref`, `cleveref`, `natbib`, `xcolor`, `caption`.

## Version history

Per-release notes and frozen PDFs are on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/CIRWEL/unitares-paper-v6/releases). Headline deltas:

- **v6.9.3** — claim correction: the abstract, model section and conclusion now say the information-theoretic definitions are target semantics and the deployed estimators are tier-3 heuristics; the stability claim covers the deployed dynamics only; the 28.9% counterfactual is described as largely mechanical (the legacy coherence is nearly constant) and as showing label changes, not correctness; production start corrected to November 2025.
- **v6.8** — operational-honesty bump: §12.4 adds a paragraph on the 2026-04-20 KG retrieval rebuild (pre-rebuild semantic scores sat at noise floor; fleet-learning claims now bounded by that era); §12.5 adds item 6 explicitly caveating retrieval-infrastructure and the PR-#54 auto-ephemeral write-bug. Grounded EISV counterfactual unaffected (inputs are `core.agent_state`, not KG content).
- **v6.7** — drift correction: runtime removed the CIRS v2 neighbor-pressure coupling on 2026-04-17; paper caught up by excising §Multi-Agent Coordination and reframing §Multi-Agent Network as a theoretical extension. §11.6 headline finding unaffected.
- **v6.6** — added §11.7 identity-system-maturity disclosure; added identity hardening track to §14.5 future work.
- **v6.5** — submission polish; aligned prose with measured per-class calibration.
- **v6.4** — added facilitator-load caveat on the §11.4 dialectic statistics (45/66 non-resolution rate framed as upper-bound under human-facilitator load rather than protocol failure).
- **v6.0–v6.3** — initial v6 release and early revisions.
